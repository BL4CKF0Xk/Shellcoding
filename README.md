# Shellcoding
Projects that i'm doing about shellcoding

## Minimized Projects

When coding a program there are bad characters in the machine code. So when creating a shellcode if this bad chars in the code, codde won't run. Also when delivering a shellcode with a exploit, Shellcode must be small. So i tried to make the code small as possible and tried to remove all 0x00 from code in this folder

## Practice_Temp

C code template to practice shellcodes and test them
